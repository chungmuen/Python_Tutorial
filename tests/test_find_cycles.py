        Tests the find_cycles function for its ability to accurately identify all unique cycles in a graph.

        This test assesses whether the find_cycles function can take a graph represented as a dictionary
        and return a list of tuples, each representing a unique cycle found within the graph. A cycle is
        defined as a path that starts and ends at the same node without traversing any node more than once,
        except for the starting/ending node.

        The assertIn method is used to verify that each expected cycle is present in the function's output,
        demonstrating the function's effectiveness in cycle detection.
